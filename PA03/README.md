Project 03: Interaction: Moons
========================================
This project is based on the previous Project, PA02.

CONTROLS:
Right Click: brings up menu: Start/Stop Spin and Quit
Left Click: Reverses Spin
Up Arrow/D: Increases Spin Speed
Down Arrow/A: Decreases Spin Speed (can go negative)
Space/S: Reverses Spin

The assigned alterations are to add the following:
1.) Add a moon orbiting the planet.    
2.) In addition to the planet orbiting and the moon orbiting the planet properly (no matter which direction it is going) you need to implement the planet direction changes with the keyboard arrows (in addition to the keyboard/mouse done last time).    
3.) (Required for Grad Students): Add text to indicate which direction the planet is rotating. This should change when the direction changes.
